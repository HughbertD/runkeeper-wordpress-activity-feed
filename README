Description: A WordPress plugin that automatically posts RunKeeper Activities as blog posts. It also provides the ability to import all of your exisiting activites as posts.

Installation:
 - The plugin currently contains two additional repositories as submodules, so the ZIP download and a standard "git clone" won't work.
 - Steps:
    - git clone --recursive https://github.com/phikai/runkeeper-wordpress-activity-feed
    - Activate Plugin from WordPress Plugins Menu
    - Authorize RunKeeper Account
    - Select Author UserID and Post Categories
